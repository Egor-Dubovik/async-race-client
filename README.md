### About
- There are two views on the site: "Garage" and "Winners".
- User can create, update, delete a car, and see the list of the cars and navigate through the pages of cars using pagination. 
- There are a button to create random cars (7 cars per click). Name is assembled from two random parts, for example "Tesla" + "Model S", or "Ford" + "Mustang" (There are 10 different names for each part).
- Of course the car race is animated (used requestAnimationFrame).
